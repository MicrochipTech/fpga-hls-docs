.. _use_debugger:

use_debugger
----------------

This parameter controls whether Blair's debugger is added to the Verilog
generated by SmartHLS.

The debugger monitors all memory transactions and checks against a working
golden data set to track down where the memory access messes up.
The debugger is turned on using a tcl parameter, use_debugger, set in config.tcl.
Another tcl parameter, :ref:`debugger_capture_mode`, is used to set the mode of
the debugger.
When it is set to 1 (which should be used on the working version of hardware),
the simulation dumps out all memory accesses (address and data for port a and b
on a read/write) to .dat files.
Once this golden data set is created, set debugger_capture_mode to 0, then
re-run shls (the SmartHLS script) and simulation on the non-working HW.
This time the simulation compares the memory accesses in the non-working HW with
the data in .dat files.
If any memory access is different from the gold data set in .dat files, it
prints out what the differences are, and stops the simulation right away.
