.. _set_top_level_argument_num_elements:

set_top_level_argument_num_elements
----------------------------


This TCL command specifies the number of elements for a top-level function's argument.
This is needed for SW/HW Co-Simulation when an argument passed into the top-level function
is a dynamically allocated array (with malloc). Statically allocated arrays 
do not need to be specified but for any dynamically allocated arrays, their 
number of elements must be specified for the Co-Simulation flow to work. 
The name of the argument needs to be specified as a string and the number of
elements of the argument needs to be specified as an unsigned integer.
When using the GUI, choose `Set top-level argument number of elements` as the 
`Constraint Type` and type in both the argument name and the number of elements 
in the `Constraint Value` box. 

For the Co-Simulation flow, the user must also specify the top-level function 
with :ref:`set_custom_top_level_module`.
