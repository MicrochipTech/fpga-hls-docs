Schedule Viewer
---------------

The Schedule Viewer shows information on how the top-level function was scheduled in hardware by SmartHLS.
This includes information on the flow of control between different functions and blocks of execution,
as well as the cycle by cycle schedule of the operations in hardware.

The Schedule Viewer can be launched by clicking the "Launch Schedule Viewer" button in the SmartHLS IDE.

Alternatively, if using the Linux commandline, you can run the Schedule Viewer command.

.. code-block:: text

    $ shls scheduleviewer

The Schedule Viewer has the Explorer tab and four views: the Call Graph, Control Flow Graph, Schedule Chart and Pipeline Viewer.
The Explorer tab lets you navigate between the functions and blocks within the design.
The Call Graph contains the directed graph of which software functions are called by which other software functions within the top-level function.
The Control Flow Graph shows the control flow of execution between the blocks within each function for if/else conditionals and loops.
The Schedule Chart and Pipeline Viewer shows the scheduling of instructions within a block or a pipeline on a cycle-by-cycle basis.

Background: LLVM Internal Representation used by SmartHLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instructions displayed in the Schedule Viewer are from the LLVM compiler that SmartHLS is built on.
These assembly-like instructions are called `LLVM intermediate representation (IR) <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>`_.
Some understanding of the LLVM IR is beneficial when using the Schedule Viewer.

For example, given the 32-bit code:

.. code-block:: c

    result = a + b – 5

This C++ code could be represented as instructions in LLVM IR as:

.. code-block::

    %0 = add i32 %a, %b
    %result = sub i32 %0, 5

In LLVM IR, intermediate variables are prefixed with a “%”.
Each operation (add/sub) includes the bitwidth “i32” indicating 32-bit integer.
The add operands are %a + %b and the result is stored in a temporary 32-bit variable %0.
The subtract operands are %0 – 5 and the result is stored in the variable %result.

Basic blocks are also important concepts in LLVM IR.
A basic block is a group of instructions that always run together with a single entry point at the beginning and a single exit point at the end.
A basic block in LLVM IR always has a label at the beginning and a branching instruction at the end (``br``, ``ret``, etc.).
Control flow occurs between basic blocks.

Here the ``body.0`` basic block performs some operations and then branches unconditionally to another basic block labeled ``body.1``.

.. code-block::

    body.0:
      %0 = add i32 %a, %b
      %result = sub i32 %0, 5
      br label %body.1

All of the basic blocks and instructions shown in the Scheduler Viewer are directly from the LLVM IR optimized by SmartHLS before being compiled into Verilog.

Call Graph
~~~~~~~~~~

When you open the Scheduler Viewer, the default view is of the Call Graph.
You can also click on the “Call Graph” tab at the top.
The Call Graph shows the top-level function and all of the sub-functions that are called.

For example the following code has a function ``main`` which calls ``top_level`` which in turn calls
``helper_func_0`` and ``helper_func_1``.
The ``noinline`` attributes makes sure that SmartHLS does not inline these small functions into the
main function body, making sure we can see them in the Call Graph.

.. code-block:: c

    __attribute__((noinline))
    void helper_func_0(int a) {
    	gv += a;
    }
    
    __attribute__((noinline))
    void helper_func_1(int a) {
    	gv -= a;
    }
    
    __attribute__((noinline))
    void top_level() {
    	helper_func_0(10);
    	helper_func_1(5);
    }
    
    int main() {
    	top_level();
    	return 0;
    }

This will generate the Call Graph shown below.
The Call Graph shows that ``main`` calls ``top_level``, which in turn calls ``helper_func_0`` and ``helper_function_1``.

Control Flow Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Control Flow Graph can be brought up by clicking on any function in the Explorer tab.
The Control Flow Graph shows the connections between basic blocks and shows which basic blocks can branch to which other basic blocks.

For example the following code has an if/else statement and then a for-loop in the else body.
This has multiple code blocks and branches to different sections of the code.

.. code-block:: c

    if (gv) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
           gv++;
        }
        return 0;
    }

This Control Flow Graph shows the two paths of the if statement on the right and the else statement on the left, and the for-loop in the left middle bubbles.
Control flow is represented by an arrow, where a basic block will only branch into another basic block that it points to.

Schedule Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you click on a non-pipelined block, the Schedule Chart will open.
This shows the scheduling of instructions within a block on a cycle-by-cycle basis.

For the following example, two multiplies are made then added and stored to a variable.

.. code-block:: c

    int mult1 = coeff1 * coeff1;
    int mult2 = coeff2 * coeff2;
    gv = mult1 + mult2;

In the Schedule Chart, we can see the instructions that these lines of code turn into and the cycles they are scheduled for.
For example, we can see the add is scheduled for cycle 4 and takes 1 cycle.
You can mouse over the scheduled instructions in the Schedule Chart and the selected instruction will be highlighted in yellow.
Instructions that the highlighted instruction depend on will be outlined in red and the instructions that depend on the highlighted instruction will be outlined in orange.
Here the add depends on the two multiplies highlighted in red. The store highlighted in orange depends on this add.

Pipeline Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you click on a pipelined block, the Pipeline Viewer will open.
This shows the scheduling of instructions within a pipelined block on a cycle-by-cycle basis.

For the following example a value is loaded an array, added to a value, then it is stored back into the array.
This is done repeatedly in a loop and the loop is pipelined.

.. code-block:: c

    #pragma HLS loop pipeline
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        array[i] = array[i] + coeff1;
    }

In the Pipeline Viewer, we find the name and initiation interval (II) for the pipeline at the top.
The column headings in the first row show the clock cycle and pipeline stages for each column.
The remaining rows show the instructions that run in the pipeline at each stage.
The left-most column indicates the loop iteration for the instructions in the row starting from Iteration 0. For function pipelines, Iteration 0 corresponds to the first input.
If you hold your mouse over an instruction you will see more details about the operation type.
In the pipeline viewer, the right-most column highlighted in a thick black box shows the behavior of the pipeline in steady state.
The last row shown in the pipeline viewer (Iteration 1) is the first iteration of the pipeline in steady state.
