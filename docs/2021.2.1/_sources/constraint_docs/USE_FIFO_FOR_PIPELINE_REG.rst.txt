.. _USE_FIFO_FOR_PIPELINE_REG:

USE_FIFO_FOR_PIPELINE_REG
---------------------------

In a pipeline circuit where multiple stages of the circuit are concurrently
active and processing different loop iterations (or function calls), *pipeline
registers* are used to retain and propagate a variable value from the
value-producing stage to the value-use stage.  The pipeline registers are
essentially a chain of shift registers with additional control logic.
When the chain of pipeline registers is long, it may be more resource-efficient
to implement the pipeline registers as a block-RAM FIFO rather than shift
registers.

When this parameter is enabled, Smart HLS will examine each chain of pipeline
registers and use the implementation (FIFO or shift register) that is estimated
to be more resource-efficient.
