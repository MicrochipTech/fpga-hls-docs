Precompiled Software
==================================

The SmartHLS Team has precompiled the following software for your convenience:

* RISC-V GNU Cross compiler (GCC 10)
* FFmpeg 4.4
* OpenCV 4.5.4

Please refer to :ref:`makefile_example` for how to specify additional software libraries.

RISC-V GNU Cross Compiler
----------------------------------

SmartHLS uses RISC-V GNU Cross compiler to compile the binary running on the
RISC-V Microprocessor Sub-System (MSS) processor of PolarFire\ :sup:`Â®`\ . You can find the
compiler at:

 * <SMARTHLS_INSTALLATION_DIR>/SmartHLS/swtools/binutils/riscv-gnu-toolchain/install/bin

.. _ffmpeg_opencv:

FFmpeg 4.4 and OpenCV 4.5.4
----------------------------------

The SmartHLS Team has precompiled FFmpeg 4.4 and OpenCV 4.5.4. They are used in
our tutorials and are made available to the users.

You can download them here:
`SmartHLS Compiled Open Source Libraries <https://www.microchip.com/en-us/software-library/smarthls-compiled-open-source-libraries>`_

Alternatively, you can download the libraries by running
``<SMARTHLS_INSTALLATION_DIR>/SmartHLS/examples/scripts/utils/download_libraries.sh`` on
a terminal (to open a terminal on Windows, please refer to
:ref:`windows_cmdline`). The script will download and extract the libraries
under ``<SMARTHLS_INSTALLATION_DIR>/SmartHLS/precompiled_libraries/``.

The x86_64 Linux libraries and the x86_64 Cygwin libraries are required to run
FFmpeg/OpenCV software on Linux and Windows respectively.
The RISC-V libraries are needed for cross-compilation and have to be copied
onto the board as described in the next section.


Copying Compiled Libraries onto Icicle Board
--------------------------------------------

After setting up by following :ref:`icicle_setup`, note the IP address of the board.

On a terminal, go to the directory where you downloaded the precompiled
libraries to extract the RISC-V libraries. Note that if you run the
``download_libraries.sh`` script as described above, the precompiled libraries
have already been extracted automatically so you do not have to run the commands
below.

| ``tar xzpf opencv4.5.4-riscv64-linux.tar.gz``
| ``tar xzpf ffmpeg4.4-riscv64-linux.tar.gz``

Now, copy the extracted precompiled libraries to your Icicle board's
``/home/root/shls_sw_dependencies`` or a folder of your choice by using the
``scp`` command:

| ``scp -r ffmpeg4.4-riscv64-linux root@<Icicle Board's IP>:/home/root/shls_sw_dependencies``
| ``scp -r opencv4.5.4-riscv64-linux root@<Icicle Board's IP>:/home/root/shls_sw_dependencies``


All external libraries, such as FFmpeg and OpenCV, must be copied onto the board,
and their references must be properly defined using :ref:`makefile` in ``Makefile.user``
in order for them to run properly on the board.

For Windows, if you do not want to use the Cygwin terminal, you can use external
programs to do the extracting and copying steps above. For example, you can use
7-Zip to extract the precompiled libraries, and FileZilla to copy the files over
to the Icicle board.
