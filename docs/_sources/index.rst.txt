.. Welcome to SmartHLS's documentation!
.. =================================

SmartHLS |version| Documentation
==============================

SmartHLS automatically compiles a C/C++ program into
hardware described in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). The
generated hardware can be programmed onto an Microchip FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate
Array).
Hardware implemented on an FPGA can provide 2-10X performance and power
benefits over the same computation running on regular processors.

.. SmartHLS includes:

  * C/C++ to Verilog high-level synthesis tool. Tested on Windows/Linux 64-bit.


The documentation is comprised of the following sections:

    * :ref:`getstarted`: Installation and a quick start guide
    * :ref:`userguide`: How to use SmartHLS to generate hardware
    * :ref:`optimizationguide`: How to optimize the generated hardware
    * :ref:`hwarch`: Synthesized hardware architecture
    * :ref:`pragmas`: Pragmas manual
    * :ref:`constraints`: Constraints manual
    * :ref:`license_setup`: How to obtain a free license for Smart HLS
    * :ref:`FAQ`: Frequently asked questions
    * :ref:`release`: New features and known problems with each release
