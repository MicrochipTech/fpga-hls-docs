Instantiating SmartHLS IP Core in Libero SmartDesign 
-------------------------------------------------

After we use SmartHLS to design a hardware IP component, we will want to instantiate
the component into Libero SmartDesign and integrate this core into our larger system.
When SmartHLS generates the hardware, SmartHLS will also generate a ``create_hdl_plus.tcl``
script to easily instantiate the SmartHLS-generated IP core into Libero SmartDesign.

You will see the log message in the console which includes the full path to the script like this: 

.. code-block:: text

  Info: Generating HDL+ Tcl script to be imported in SmartDesign: C:\SmartHLS-2021.2\workspace\sobel_part3\create_hdl_plus.tcl. 

Now we can use Libero to open a Libero project, create a new SmartDesign, and give the newly created SmartDesign a suitable name.
Alternatively, we can also open an existing SmartDesign.

        :align: center

We now go to the Libero ``Project`` menu and select ``Execute Script`` and give the path to
the generated ``create_hdl_plus.tcl`` script as shown in the figures below. Then click ``Run``.
Running the Tcl script will add the SmartHLS-generated HDL+ component (``sobel_filter_top`` in this example),
all required Verilog files, memory initialization files, and other dependencies to the Libero project.

        :scale: 100 %
        :align: center

As shown in the figures below, we can now instantiate the component in SmartDesign by right-clicking on the HDL+ component
(``sobel_filter_top`` in this example) in the ``Design Hiearchy`` panel on the left and selecting ``Instantiate in system``.
In the SmartDesign system we will now see the new IP component (``sobel_filter_top_0`` in this example).

The generated ``create_hdl_plus.tcl`` script will automatically group ports as AXI4-Master, AXI4-Slave or AXI4-Stream
interfaces if they match the corresponding AXI4 specifications. In this example, since the ``sobel_filter_top`` IP component
used SmartHLS FIFOs as top-level arguments and they match AXI4-Stream specifications, SmartHLS has automatically grouped
the ``output_fifo`` and ``input_fifo`` data/ready/valid ports as AXI4-Stream interfaces.

We also have the option to expose the sub-signals under the AXI4-Stream bus. This will allow us to connect individual
ports instead of the entire bus. To do this, right click on the AXI4-Stream bus on the SmartHLS-generated IP component
and choose Show/Hide BIF Pins. Then choose the sub-signals as appropriate. For example, in the figures below, if we
choose all 3 sub-signals and press OK, we will see the 3 corresponding ports in the IP component: ``output_fifo_ready``
as an input, and ``output_fifo[7:0]`` and ``output_fifo_axi4stream`` as the outputs.
