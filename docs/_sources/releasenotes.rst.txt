Release Date: Feb 4, 2022

What's New
--------------

 * In December 2021, we made a webinar on "How Microchip FPGAs Can Improve Productivity in Motor Control Applications Using C++ With HLS".
   The webinar is now available on-demand: https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3504585/754DA52F256BFC4463D5751661C3037F

Software Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------------

 * All SmartHLS-generated output files are now put under the ``hls_output`` directory, except the auto-generated project configuration files ``makefile`` and ``config.tcl``.
 * The SmartHLS-generated Verilog output is now self-contained, by including all Verilog sub-IPs in the `hls_output/rtl` directory.
   * The Sub-IP module names are prefixed with the SmartHLS project name.
 * Improve struct packing for array of structs (:ref:`struct_support`).
 * Provide a ``__SYNTHESIS__`` macro to wrap around the code that should only be enabled for HLS synthesis (``#ifdef __SYNTHESIS__``), or to exclude non-synthesizable code (``#ifndef __SYNTHESIS__``). See more details in :ref:`synthesis_macro`.


Resolved Issues
----------------

The following defects and enhancement requests were resolved:

 * HLS-568: Fix an incorrect optimization of uninitialized arrays.
 * HLS-558: SW/HW CoSimulation to support struct argument that contains a typedef of FIFO.
 * HLS-573: SW/HW CoSimulation fix about boolean return type from top-level function.
 * HLS-576: Support boolean pragma fields for C programs.
 * HLS-575: Support different return types of C function declaration and definition (C linker allows the declaration to use a different return type from the definition).
 * HLS-572: Fix a corner case bug of indirect access of arrays.
 * HLS-383: Fix int64_t or uint64_t mismatch behaviour in SW/HW CoSimulation.
 * HLS-263: Fix the IP conflict issue between HLS cores generated by different versions of SmartHLS.
 * HLS-235: Skip including unused Verilog IPs in create_hdl_plus.tcl to speed up 'Build Hierarchy' in Libero.
 * HLS-542: Improve error messages for struct packing feature.
 * HLS-534: Fix the Schedule Viewer's control-flow diagram on Windows.
 * HLS-582: Fix the file import dialog in Eclipse IDE.



Previous Releases
==================

SmartHLS 2021.3
---------------------

Release Date: Nov 26, 2021

What's New
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * A :ref:`vhls_to_shls` on how to migrate designs from other HLS tool to SmartHLS.

Software Features and Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Enhanced Co-Simulation flow to support more sophisticated software testbenches, specifically those use high-level C++ features such as templates, classes, inheritance, namespaces, nested types and typedef.
 * Improved expression balancing optimization to reduce cycle latency of generated hardware (see :ref:`LATENCY_REDUCTION` settings).
 * Improved support of AXI4 target (slave) interface in a pipelined function.
 * Added support for floating-point ordered/unordered operations.
 * Added support of packed FIFOs (see :ref:`rtl_interface_fifo_argument`) in Co-Simulation.
 * Added full lists of supported device options in the IDE's device selection menu.
 * The :ref:`schedule_viewer` now shows the latency and source code location in the control flow graph to ease latency analysis.
 * Improved error checking for invalid constraint settings.


Resolved Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following defects and enhancement requests were resolved:

 * HLS-506: Fixed an issue related to pipelined functions using external memory.
 * HLS-532: JRE version update to include the latest security fixes and enhancements.
 * HLS-484: Fixed the re-initialization of aliased global variables after a reset is triggered.
 * HLS-48: Bug fix in bit-width minimization optimization.


SmartHLS 2021.2.1
---------------------

Release Date: Sept 24, 2021

What's New
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * SmartHLS now supports IGLOO2 device family.

Software Features and Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * A new **branchless** :ref:`pragma_function_flatten` feature to improve parallelism between operations.
 * A new :ref:`pragma_replicate_rom` pragma to enable and control the replication of designated read-only arrays for achieving better circuit throughput.
 * Support for packing interfaces and memories with struct types into a wide scalar using the new pack pragma (see :ref:`struct_support`).
 * Support struct as a return type for the top-level HLS function (see :ref:`struct_support`).
 * Support for constant static struct members in SW/HW CoSimulation.
 * Disabled automatic unrolling of pipelined loops and their outer loops. Disabling automatic unrolling saves design size without noticeable loss in performance. A pipelined loop can still be explicitly unrolled with a :ref:`pragma_loop_unroll` pragma.
 * Updated the user guide section on :ref:`cmdline`.


Resolved Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following defects and enhancement requests were resolved:

 * HLS-461: Fixed the initialization of global array of ap_fixpt type.
 * HLS-419: Some of the generated AXI4 slave controllers have IIs greater than 1.
 * HLS-420: Excessive use of block RAMs (specifically uSRAMs) due to a sub-optimal heuristic when packing pipeline registers into FIFO-like constructs.
 * HLS-443: Partition pragma is incorrectly overridden by default partitioning.
 * HLS-446: Incorrect mapping of completely partitioned array of struct.
 * HLS-475: Nested struct definitions may have an incorrect order in Co-Simulation.
 * HLS-456: Loops containing inner pipelined loops are automatically unrolled, leading to a significant increase in resources.
 * HLS-53: Removed the internal primitive operations from scheduleviewer.



SmartHLS 2021.2
---------------------

Release Date: August 06, 2021

What's New
~~~~~~~~~~~

 * SmartHLS is now installed by default with Libero 2021.2 for general release.
 * Free licenses are provided for SmartHLS, please refer to the instructions here to :ref:`license_setup`.

Software Features and Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Improved optimizations to minimize signal bit-width to reduce resource usage.
 * Improved multiplier area for wide multipliers (>64-bits).
 * Added a ``struct_fields`` type to the memory partition pragma (see :ref:`struct_fields_memory_partitioning`), which is to specify the intention to partition a struct into its individual elements.
 * Added a new "Synthesize Hardware to FPGA" feature that only runs RTL synthesis without place-and-route to obtain accurate FPGA resource usage faster.
 * Deprecated the ``scalar_memory`` type from the interface pragma. Please instead use a ``complete`` type memory partition pragma on the top-level pointer argument to achieve the same effect (see :ref:`complete_memory_partitioning`).
 * Deprecated the C arbitrary bitwidth library (``hls/types.h``) and C bit-level operations library (``hls/bit_level_operations.h``). Please use the :ref:`ap_lib` instead for better quality of result of the generated hardware.
 * Windows installation no longer adds system environment variables and Windows IDE no longer uses system environment variables.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Excessive use of block RAMs (specifically uSRAMs) due to a sub-optimal heuristic when packing pipeline registers into FIFO-like constructs.
   The issue has been fixed in the 2021.2.1 release.
   For the 2021.2 release, here is the workaround to disable packing pipeline registers into FIFO to avoid the issue:
  1. Open the ``HLS Constraints`` dialog, choose ``Set custom config file`` constraint type and put in a file name (e.g., ``custom_config.tcl``) for the constraint value, click "Add" then "OK"
  2. Create a new custom config file in the project folder with the same filename as above (e.g., ``custom_config.tcl``).
  3. Put the following line in the custom config file: ``set_parameter USE_FIFO_FOR_PIPELINE_REG 0``
