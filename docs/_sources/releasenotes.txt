LegUp HLS EAP 2021.1.2 Release Notes
---------------------------------

Release date: April 23, 2021

Software Features and Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Full support for complex software testbenches.
 * Automatically trigger re-compilation if needed to generate the software binary or Verilog when the C++ source code, Makefile, or TCL config files changed.
 * Added limited SW/HW Co-Simulation support for multi-threading when all threads are joined in the function where the threads are forked.
 * Added support for user-specified arguments of the main() function in software testbench.
 * Added AP_RND_ZERO quantization mode to the ap_fixpt C++ library.
 * Added a range() method to ap_int and ap_fixpt C++ libraries.
 * Added a simulation with waves feature to LegUp IDE for custom testbench.

Resolved Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following defects and enhancement requests were resolved:

 * HLS-59:     RTL Interface: fix memory port names
 * HLS-174:    Spaces in LegUp workspace path makes synthesis fail. Add user error message to avoid spaces.
 * HLS-177:    Change the header files on Windows
 * HLS-199:    Add documentation comment to LegUp Library classes like ap_int similar to ap_fixpt so the user can mouse over the type in Eclipse and get the usage information
 * HLS-225:    create_hdl_plus.tcl does not properly import mem_init files
 * HLS-232:    Update windows installer link to LegUp getting started guide
 * HLS-255:    After project import LegUp IDE does not save HLS constraints changes when closing
 * HLS-269:    Missing legup_array_depth=1 for struct pass-in-by-reference
 * HLS-277:    Automatically add array-depth attribute to pass-in-by-value structs.
 * HLS-278:    Hardware functions are incorrectly removed by PreprocessThreadLib pass
 * HLS-279:    Interface Report: Struct type IORam is incorrectly considered as scalar memory
 * HLS-280:    Interface Report: byte-enable signal is not properly recognized for non-struct yet byte-enabled RAMs


LegUp HLS EAP 9.2.1 Release Notes
---------------------------------

Release date: March 3, 2021

Software Features and Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Added support for new ``legup::thread`` multi-threading API (see :ref:`pthreads_multithreading`)

Resolved Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following defects and enhancement requests were resolved:

 * HLS-42: Libero 12.6 complains about set_option -rom_map_logic.
 * HLS-50: Sobel tutorial part 3 to match the syntax as part 1 & 2.
 * HLS-59: Fix the memory port names to a more understandable convention.
 * HLS-60: Give a proper error when there are multiple top-level functions specified.
 * HLS-63: Sefault if the top-level function pragma is removed from Sobel tutorial part 1.
 * HLS-78: Loop pipeline support for variable loop bounds.
 * HLS-97: Fmax improvements for customer design.
 * HLS-121: Cannot access AXI4 slave without starting the accelerator (in concurrent_access mode).
 * HLS-129: Loop unrolling crashes some designs.
 * HLS-142: Running Libero synthesis, P&R from LegUp will fail with Libero 12.5 or before on Windows.
 * HLS-149: LLVM's loop-unswitch performs an unwanted loop replication.
 * HLS-156: CoSim: wrong values for ap_uint type being fed to the DUT.
 * HLS-162: Verilog name conflict in generated Verilog between a RAM instance and a register.
 * HLS-164: Cannot expand grouped AXI4stream ports in SmartDesign for HDL+ block.
 * HLS-165: Some memory interfaces are not showing in the interface report.
 * HLS-168: Clang errors out with none type memory partition pragma.
 * HLS-200: Can't set multiply latency when split mult is enabled.
 * HLS-201: Execute create_hdl_plus.tcl from Libero got LEGUP_ROOT_DIR not set error.
 * HLS-203: ScheduleViewer does not work when LegUp installation and workspace are in different drives.
 * HLS-206: Red-line in Eclipse complaining about legup::thread/ref.
