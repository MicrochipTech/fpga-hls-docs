Getting Started
==================

Microchip is running an Early Access Program (EAP) for the SmartHLS compiler
software. This program enables you to evaluate a beta version of SmartHLS
software and provide us with valuable feedback. To participate in EAP and download
SmartHLS, please fill out the
`SmartHLS software request form here
<https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/fpga-design-tools/5590-hls#software-download>`_
and we will contact you to support your evaluation.

Installation
------------

SmartHLS supports Windows 10 and Linux (CentOS 7).

Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the Windows installer program, ``SmartHLS-2021.2-Win64-Setup.exe``, and go through the steps in the installer.

Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++

CentOS
******

The CentOS installer is packaged as a self-extracting shell script that can be installed to a local
directory. To run the installer::

    cd $(INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY)
    sh /path/to/smarthls-2021.2-centos-installer.run

This will install SmartHLS into the INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY.  After the
installation is completed, please add the SmartHLS bin directory to your path::

    export PATH=$(INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY)/smarthls-2021.2/smarthls/bin:$PATH

Libero and ModelSim 
+++++++++++++++++++++

You will need to install the `Libero SoC software
<https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc>`_
to synthesize the generated hardware for Microchip FPGAs.
After installing Libero, please make sure to download all of new IP cores (open a Libero project, go to the Catalog pane, and click on "Download them now!", as shown below), as some IPs may be needed for SmartHLS.

        :align: center


Libero also comes with ModelSim which is used by SmartHLS to simulate the
generated Verilog. 
Please note that the first time you simulate a generated hardware block with a fresh install of SmartHLS, ModelSim will compile our IP libraries, which may take some time.
