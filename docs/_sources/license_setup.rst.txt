SmartHLS License
==================================

Setup
------

Please follow the below instructions to generate and install SmartHLS tool license:

#.  Log into `Microchip Direct > FPGA Software and IP Core Products
    <https://www.microchipdirect.com/fpga-software-products?_ga=2.64389999.1724603044.1642798569-550376685.1606760895>`_.
#.  Click on the "Request Free License" button on the right.

   .. image:: /images/license_screenshot_request.png
        :align: center

#.  Click "Register" beside either the "SmartHLS 1 Year Node Locked License for
    Windows" or "SmartHLS 1 Year Floating License for Windows or Linux Server".

   .. image:: /images/license_screenshot_register.png
        :align: center

#.  On the next page, enter the hard Disk ID (for node locked license) or MAC ID (for
    floating license) of the machine based on the selected license option and click on
    the "Submit" button. You will then be emailed a new ``license.dat`` license
    file enabling you to use SmartHLS.
#.  Open the SmartHLS ``license.dat`` file and copy the contents into your
    existing Libero software license file with the same Libero license option
    (Disk ID or MAC ID). For example, if you generated a node locked license for
    the SmartHLS tool, you need to add the SmartHLS license file contents into the
    Libero node locked license file.
#.  Double check that your ``LM_LICENSE_FILE`` environment variable is set correctly.
    
.. note::

    If you have not yet installed the license for the Libero Design Suite Software, refer to
    https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/licensing or
    your Libero license file email for instructions on how to download and install
    your Libero license and software.


Debugging License Issues
-----------------------------

If you are having license issues with SmartHLS try the following steps:

1. Double check the ``LM_LICENSE_FILE`` is printed correctly in the SmartHLS license error message:

   .. code-block:: text

            Error: There is a problem with your SmartHLS feature license.
            Your current environment variable is: LM_LICENSE_FILE=1702@server.domain.com
            Please modify your LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable and restart SmartHLS.

   If you changed your ``LM_LICENSE_FILE`` environment variable then you will need to restart the SmartHLS IDE to detect the change. 

2. Otherwise, on Windows run Start -> Command Prompt.  In the command prompt, run this command to debug issues checking out the "SmartHLS" feature:

   .. code-block:: console

            C:\Microchip\Libero_SoC_v2023.1\Designer\bin\lmutil.exe lmdiag SmartHLS

   Make sure you can see ``This license can be checked out``. For example:

   .. code-block:: text

            -----------------------------------------------------
            License file: 1702@server.domain.com
            -----------------------------------------------------
            "SmartHLS" v2022.08, vendor: actlmgrd, expiry: 14-aug-2041
            License server: 10.241.70.175
            floating license  expires: 14-aug-2041

            This license can be checked out

   If not, you will need to update your license.dat file to include the SmartHLS feature line.

3. You can also check how many SmartHLS licenses are in use with:

   .. code-block:: console

            C:\Microchip\Libero_SoC_v2023.1\Designer\bin\lmutil.exe lmstat -f SmartHLS


When is the License Checked?
-----------------------------

SmartHLS does not check the license when opening the SmartHLS IDE or when running the standard software flow (compiling/debugging/execution).

SmartHLS will check for a valid license when ``Compile Software to Hardware`` is clicked to compile software to hardware:

SmartHLS will also check for a valid license whenever running `shls` commands from the :ref:`cmdline`.
