Getting Started
==================

License Setup
--------------

First, you will need to setup :ref:`license_setup`.

Installation
------------

SmartHLS supports Windows 10 and Linux (CentOS 7).

Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the Windows installer program, ``SmartHLS-2022.2.1-Win64-Setup.exe``, and go through the steps in the installer.

Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++

CentOS
******

The CentOS installer is packaged as a self-extracting shell script that can be installed to a local
directory. To run the installer::

    cd $(INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY)
    sh /path/to/smarthls-2022.2.1-centos-installer.run

This will install SmartHLS into the INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY.  After the
installation is completed, please add the SmartHLS bin directory to your path::

    export PATH=$(INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY)/smarthls-2022.2.1/smarthls/bin:$PATH

Libero and ModelSim 
+++++++++++++++++++++

You will need to install the `Libero SoC software
<https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions>`_
to synthesize the generated hardware for Microchip FPGAs.
After installing Libero, please make sure to download all of new IP cores (open a Libero project, go to the Catalog pane, and click on "Download them now!", as shown below), as some IPs may be needed for SmartHLS.

Libero also comes with ModelSim which is used by SmartHLS to simulate the
generated Verilog. 
Please note that the first time you simulate a generated hardware block with a fresh install of SmartHLS, ModelSim will compile our IP libraries, which may take some time.
